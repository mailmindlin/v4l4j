#summary this page explains how to download, build and test libvideo
#sidebar LibvideoApiSideBar

=Tested Hardware=
See TestedHardware page for a list of platforms and video devices libvideo has been successfully tested with.

=Download=
libvideo is included in v4l4j, in the libvideo/ subdirectory.
If you want to download only libvideo (not the entire v4l4j project), use the following command:
{{{
svn co http://v4l4j.googlecode.com/svn/v4l4j/trunk/libvideo
}}}

=Requirements=
libvideo requires make, gcc and a V4L-supported video source. It has been successfully compiled with gcc 4.2.3 and gcc 4.1.2

=Build=
Run "make" in the libvideo/ directory

=Usage=
libvideo is a library and is meant to be linked to an application. To this end, check the [libvideoAPI libvideo API] page for documentation and examples on how to use libvideo.

=Example applications=
libvideo comes with three test programs which can be used as examples:
 * 'test-capture' is used to print the maximum achievable frame rate. It runs a capture from a given video device at a given resolution for  10 seconds and then prints the frame rate.
 * 'dump-catpure' which is similar to the previous application, except that it will write the captured frames to disk,
 * 'list-caps' which lists information about a given video device.

To compile the test programs, run "make test" in libvideo/.

In addition to these simple programs, the libvideo/example/ directory contains a lighweight application called light_cap, which captures frames and sends them out as a multipart JPEG stream suitable for viewing in <img> tags of any standard-compliant web browser (no java applet required). The video stream can also be viewed in standard programs such as ffplay and VLC. See libvideo/example/README for more details.

=Debugging=
libvideo contains lots of debug statements which are disabled by default. To enable them, use 'DEBUG=1 make clean test'. Extra output will be produced to allow troubleshooting.

=Issues=
Feedback is is greatly appreciated to expand the list of platforms and video devices libvideo has been successfully tested with.
Feedback, issues and queries can be emailed to the [http://groups.google.com/group/v4l4j v4l4j mailing list] along with a description of what went wrong (or right) and what hardware you run libvideo on.
