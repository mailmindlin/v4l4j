This page explains how to setup v4l4j on Raspberry Pi.

= Introduction =
v4l4j has been successfully built and tested on two flavours of the Debian distribution for RPi: 
 * Raspbian Wheezy, which is built  with armv6 specific instructions, vector floating point instructions and specify the ARM EABI where floating point values are to be passed in floating point registers.
 * Wheezy beta, which unlike the previous one, does not use hardware register to pass floating point values.
Both can be downloaded from [http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads here].
 
If you are unsure about which version you have, check the contents of `/boot/issue.txt` and look for `armhf`. If you find it, you are most likely running Raspbian.

Make sure you identify which version you are running and follow the appropriate steps for it.

= Building v4l4j on RPi =

Install what's required to build v4l4j with :
{{{
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk ant libjpeg8-dev
sudo apt-get remove openjdk-6-*
}}}

Check out a copy of v4l4j:
{{{
svn co http://v4l4j.googlecode.com/svn/v4l4j/trunk v4l4j-trunk
cd v4l4j-trunk
}}}

*On Raspbian Wheezy:*
{{{
export JDK_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-armhf/ 
export LIBPIXFC=pixfc-sse/libpixfc-sse-armv6l-hardfp.a 
ant clean all
sudo LIBPIXFC="${LIBPIXFC}" ant install
}}}

*On Wheezy beta: *
{{{
export JDK_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-armel/ 
export LIBPIXFC=pixfc-sse/libpixfc-sse-armv6l-softfp.a
ant clean all
sudo LIBPIXFC="${LIBPIXFC}" ant install
}}}
