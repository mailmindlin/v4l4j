#summary this page presents the libvideo API and its header files
#sidebar LibvideoApiSideBar

Information on libvideo is split across multiple pages:

 * The [libvideo libvideo] page gives a short introduction to libvideo and how it came about.
 * The DownloadBuildUsage page explains how to download it, compile it and use it.
 * The [libvideoAPI API] page (this page) explains how to write a program with libvideo.

=libvideo API=
*libvideo is NOT reentrant ! Only one thread should call libvideo methods at any time.* The application using libvideo is responsible for implementing a proper locking mechanism.

The libvideo API is divided in five categories (or interfaces):
 # *[VideoDeviceInterface The video device interface]*. This is the main interface which is used to acquire other interfaces,
 # *[CaptureInterface The capture interface]* used to capture images from the device,
 # *[ControlInterface The control interface]* used to access video controls,
 # *[QueryInterface The query interface]* used to gather information on the video device,
 # *[TunerInterface The tuner interface]* used to control tuners on the video device.
An interface provides a set of methods related in functionality. Using an interface is a two step process: 
 * you first *acquire the interface* you want to access by calling the right method on the main interface (video device). You can then use this interface.
 * when you are done, you must *release the interface* by calling the appropriate method on the main interface.
Interfaces are independent from each other and can be used regardless of which other interfaces are currently acquired. This allows for instance a user to run a GUI to access video controls while another application is concurrently streaming video from the same device. Obviously, this is only possible if the driver allows multiple applications to concurrently open the same device file while allowing only one application to stream video. The Linux UVC driver works this way.

= Header files = 
The main header file is `libvideo.h` and contains all user-side required structures, function definitions and macros. `palettes.h` contains the definitions of an array of `struct libvideo_palette` which can be used to translate a libvideo palette index to its textual name. `livideo-err.h` contains all the macro definitions for returned values representing error codes.

= Image formats =
libvideo has an index for every single image format existing in Video4Linux. These indexes are marcos defined in `libvideo.h` and listed here for convenience. A global array of `struct libvideo_palette` named `libvideo_palettes` translates an image format index into a textual name (include `palettes.h` for that). See the example below.

{{{
#include "palettes.h"

...
int fmt = YUV420;
printf("Palette index: %d - name: %s\n", fmt, libvideo_palettes[fmt].name);

}}}

Below is a list of known image formats and their libvideo index. For a description of each image format, check [http://www.linuxtv.org/downloads/video4linux/API/V4L2_API/spec/c2030.htm this page] in the V4L2 specs.
