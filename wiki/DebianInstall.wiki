v4l4j is made of four Debian packages:
  * *libv4l4j-java* contains the core v4l4j Java packages and the associated JNI library,
  * *libvideo* contains an abstraction of the Video4Linux API and is required by libv4l4j-java,
  * *libv4l4j-java-doc* contains the JavaDoc of the v4l4j API (installed in `/usr/share/doc/libv4l4j-java-doc/api`),
  * *libv4l4j-bin* contains Desktop shortcut and icons to launch a GUI application to control video devices and view video streams.

*You must install at least libvideo0 and libv4l4j-java* . The JAR package is installed in `/usr/lib/java/v4l4j.jar` and the JNI library is in `/usr/lib/jni/libv4l4j.so` .

*Starting with version 0.8.8, the Debian packages only support Lucid and subsequent releases.*
You have two options:
  * *Add v4l4j's APT repository* and let apt-get install v4l4j and handle its dependencies
  * *Manually download the v4l4j packages*, install the dependencies followed by the v4l4j packages,

== APT repository ==
  * Add the v4l4j APT repository with
{{{
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gillesg/ppa
}}}
  * Install libv4l4j-java with:
{{{
sudo apt-get udpate
sudo apt-get install libv4l4j-java
}}}

== Manual download ==
The latest packages are available on the [https://launchpad.net/~gillesg/+archive/ppa/+packages Launchpad PPA page].
  * Download the latest versions of libvideo0 and libv4l4j-java. You need at least these two packages.
  * Run the following (I assume you have already installed a JRE 6):
{{{
sudo apt-get install libjpeg62
sudo dpkg -i libvideo0_XXX.deb libv4l4j-java_XXX.deb
}}}
(Replace XXX with the right version info)
  * To install libv4l4j-bin, use:
{{{
sudo apt-get install jarwrapper realpath
sudo dpkg -i libv4l4j-bin_XXX.deb
}}}
