= Compilation issues =

==Missing headers==
*Question:*
I get an error at compile time about `jni.h` or `jpeglib.h` not found. What do I do ?

*Answer:*
v4l4j has a few dependencies that must be satisfied before you attempt compiling it. Make sure you have installed:
  * the libjpeg package
  * libjpeg development package
  * a JDK 6, either from SUN or OpenJDK
  * the ant package
  * essential packages to build C programs (gcc, ld, make, C library header files...)

If you get this error:
{{{
v4l4j_FrameGrabber.c: error: jni.h: No such file or directory
}}}
then set the `JDK_HOME` environment variable to point to the directory where you the JDK is installed. For instance 
{{{
set JDK_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java" ant clean all
}}}

If you get this error:
{{{
v4l4j_FrameGrabber.c: error: jpeglib.h: No such file or directory
}}}
you have not installed the development files on libjpeg. It is usually a matter of installing the proper package. In Ubuntu / Debian, it is called `libjpeg-dev`, on OpenSuse / Fedora Core `libjpeg-devel`, on Mandriva `libjpeg62-dev`.

=Runtime issues=

==JNI Library issues==
*Question:*
I try to run my own Java program but the JVM complains that it cant load the JNI library `libv4l4j.so`:
{{{
Cant load v4l4j JNI library
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no v4l4j in java.library.path
	at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(ClassLoader.java:1682)
	at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0(Runtime.java:823)
	at java.lang.System.loadLibrary(System.java:1030)
        ....
}}}

*Answers*:
  * Have you compiled and installed the JNI library (`libv4l4j.so`) ?
Run `ant clean all && sudo ant install` in the v4l4j directory.

  * Is the JNI library in the JVM library path ?
Make sure you tell the JVM where to find the v4l4j JNI library (`libv4l4j.so`) with  `-Djava.library.path=/path/to/JNI/lib/dir`. *Note the path is the directory where `libv4l4j.so` is located, not the actual path to `libv4l4j.so`.*


==Video streaming==

==Low FPS==
*Question:*
I have a `FrameGrabber` object using image format XX & I get a very low frame rate. How can I improve it ?

*Answer:*
First, make sure you disable auto-exposure. This is usually done through one of the controls. You may have to load extra controls for your device using `uvcdynctrl`.

Some video devices can achieve higher frame rates if you select the right image format. For instance, on my test machine, the Hauppauge HVR 1300 card produces around 9 frames per second using YUYV, but achieves 29 frames per second if I use RGB32.
First, find out the image formats supported by your video device by running the following command in the v4l4j directory (replace /dev/video0 with your device file):
{{{
ant deviceInfo -Dtest.device=/dev/video0
}}}
Check the "Supported formats" section in the output. Each format has a name and an index.
Second, for each supported format, run the test-fps command using (replace /dev/video0 with your device file, and replace XX with the index of the desired image format index, as per the output of the previous command):
{{{
ant test-fps  -Dtest.device=/dev/video0 -Dtest.inFormat=XX -DoutFormat=0
}}}
This command will tell you the maximum frame rate you can achieve with the given image format.

==JVM crash==
==SegFault==
*Question:*
When using v4l4j, the JVM crashes. What shall I do ?

*Answser:*
Most of the time, this happens because of a bug in the JNI code. [ContactMailingList Contact the mailing list] and
submit a precise description of what you did to trigger the crash.
