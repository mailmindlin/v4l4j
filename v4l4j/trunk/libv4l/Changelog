v0.5.6:
- Added selection of the best palette to achieve capture resolution closest
  to the one requested. After adding support for linux UVC driver, i noticed
  MJPEG palette couldnt capture at higher resolutions (>930x720), whereas
  YUYV could. So now, the best palette is chosen (amongst the one requested
  by user) so the resolution is as close as possible to the one requested.
v0.5.5:
- Added detection and reporting of extended controls (first pass). The
  extended controls are listed, duplicates with classic controls are removed
  and the unique ones are reported as normal V4L2 controls. The next step is
  to add methods to the interface so ext. controls can be changed at once.
- Tested Logitech Quickcam Communicate Deluxe with the linux UVC driver, for
  which I added support for YUYV (YUV422) and MJPEG formats. There is no need
  to probe the linux UVC driver as it doesnt have any private ioctl (as of
  SVN revision 246).

v0.5.4:
- replaced libv4l generic code with a struct libv4l_actions to avoid the
  overhead of calling two methods to get the job done(1 method to check the
  V4L version and another to do the job). Instead, the user now calls
  the right method straight away by using struct libv4l_actions which is
  set at initialisation and points to the right methods straight away.
  
v0.5.3:
- Improved mmap code for V4L1
- added error return codes and improved console output when initialisation
  & setup of video device fails
- added support for more image formats. The whole list :
  YUV420 - RGB24 - RGB32 - YUYV - RGB555 - RGB565 - GREY
- user can now specify a list of acceptable image formats 

v0.5.1:
- Added support for V4L1 devices
- renamed to libv4l


v0.3.1:
- Groupped open_device() and check_cap_param() under init_libv4l2() to fix an
  issue with controls being listed before checking if the video device is V4L2
- as a consequence, close_device() is now called by del_libv4l2()

v0.3.0:
- Fixed buffer overrun issues with probe-pwc
- dropped frame.c and frame.h
