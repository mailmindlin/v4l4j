/*
 * This program runs a series of video capture tests from a video device (whose
 * device file is given as sole argument). It is used to test driver behaviour
 * and conformance to the V4L2 API.
 *
 * A video capture test consists of the following:
 * - check the given device supports V4L2 and streaming capture,
 * - setting up capture resolution and pixel format,
 * - request v4l2 buffers and mmap them to this program's address space,
 * - enqueue v4l2 buffers and start streaming
 * - capture a few frames
 * - stop streaming
 * - unmmap  v4l2 buffers
 *
 * The capture resolution, pixel format, number of v4l2 buffers requested,
 * number of captured frames can be adjusted by changing their values in v4l.h
 *
 * The number of video capture tests executed is also configurable.
