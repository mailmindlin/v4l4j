- USB - 046d:0990 Logitech Quickcam Pro 9000 (bcdDevice 0.08 -Linux UVC)
  (This webcam comes in several different versions, see [1]. The one
  tested suffers from a bug reported on the v4l4j mailing list, see [2].
  This bug has been fixed in kernel 2.6.28. In the meanwhile, switching
  between YUV and MJPEG will cause the next capture to hang.)
- USB - 0471:0311 Philips PCVC740K ToUcam Pro (pwc 10.0.13) 	
- PCI - 0070:9600 Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-1300 DVB-T (cx88_blackbird & family)
  (This is a hybrid Analogue TV / DVB-T with S-Video and composite inputs.
  The card has an MPEG encoder chip (NOT decoder). As of now, v4l4j only
  supports the Video4Linux API, not the DVB API. This means that only analogue
  signals from this card (Analogue TV, S-Video and Composite signals) can be 
  captured with v4l4j, ie nothing from DVB-T.)

Currently, libvideo will probe and detect the following drivers:
- PWC 		v10.0.13
  PWC is already a V4L2 driver. Most of its private ioctls are already
  exported as V4L2 controls, except for the following three (which should be
  exported as extended controls in the camera control class in the future ?)
  Exported private ioctls:
    VIDIOCPWCMPTRESET (Pan/Tilt reset))
    VIDIOCPWCMPTGANGLE (Get Pan/Tilt angle)
    VIDIOCPWCMPTSANGLE (Set Pan/Tilt angle)

- gspca 	v01.00.20
  gspca in its current version is still a V4L1 driver although the author
  is actively working on porting it to V4L2. But for now, a few private
  ioctls dont have a V4L1 control counterpart, so libvideo exports the
  following private ioctls:
    SPCASVIDIOPARAM / SPCAGVIDIOPARAM (Set and Get autobrightness, quality,
    frame interval and image flicker)

- qc-usb	v0.6.6
  qc-usb (Quickcam driver) is V4L1 driver and many private ioctls are not
  available as V4L1 control. libvideo exposes the following ioctls:
    VIDIOCQCSSETTLE / VIDIOCQCGSETTLE (Let Brigthness settle ???)
    VIDIOCQCSCOMPRESS / VIDIOCQCGCOMPRESS (compression factor)
    VIDIOCQCSQUALITY / VIDIOCQCGQUALITY (interpolation)
    VIDIOCQCSADAPTIVE / VIDIOCQCGADAPTIVE (autobrightness)
    VIDIOCQCSEQUALIZE / VIDIOCQCGEQUALIZE (equalise image)
