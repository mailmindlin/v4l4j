Thanks to all v4l4j users for spending time testing, reporting bugs and 
successes, submitting examples and improving the code.

v4l4j uses libv4l_convert to convert many exotic & chip-specific image formats
to well-known ones, namely RGB24, BGR24, YUV420 & YVU420. libv4l_convert is part
of the libv4l project, written by Hans de Goede (j.w.r.degoede <aT> hhs.nl). 
libv4l can be downloaded from the Video4Linux Mercurial repository at
