/**
 * An instance of a <code>VideoDevice</code> object represents an existing V4L 
 * video device. It is the starting point to use functionalities provided by 
 * v4l4j, which are divided in 3 categories:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Information gathering about the video device,</li>
 * <li>Capturing frames from the video device,</li>
 * <li>Accessing and controlling tuners,</li>
 * <li>and Adjusting values of available video controls.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Each of these categories is detailed in the following sections.
 * To use features provided in any of these categories, a <code>VideoDevice</code>
 * object must first be instantiated. This is done simply by calling the 
 * constructor and giving it the full path to the associated device file:
 * <br><code>
 * VideoDevice vd = new VideoDevice("/dev/video0");
 * </code><br>
 * <b>It is important that, once the <code>VideoDevice</code> is no longer used,
 * its resources are freed. This is done by calling the {@link #release()}
 * method:</b>
 * <br><code>vd.release();</code>
 * <br>Once the <code>VideoDevice</code> is released, neither itself nor any
 * object references obtained through it must be used.
 * <h2>Information gathering</h2>
 * A <code>VideoDevice</code> object offers a single method 
 * ({@link #getDeviceInfo()}) to return information about itself, encapsulated 
 * in a {@link DeviceInfo} object. DeviceInfo objects contain
 * get-type methods only, and return details such as:
 * <ul>
 * <li>List of all video inputs, their types & their supported standards</li>
 * <li>Details about available tuners (type, frequency range & unit, ...) </li>
 * <li>List of image formats & capture resolutions supported by the device</li>
 * </ul>
 * See the {@link DeviceInfo} class for an example on how to use it. Note that
 * most video device drivers do not allow multiple processes to open the device
 * at the same time. Depending on the driver, this restriction can be seen in
 * different ways. One of them is {@link #getDeviceInfo()} will throw a
 * {@link V4L4JException} if a process is already using the device.
 * <h2>Capturing frames</h2>
 * In order to capture frames from a video device, you must first obtain an 
 * object implementing the {@link FrameGrabber} interface. The 
 * {@link VideoDevice} objects provides several methods for that, 
 * depending on the image format required:
 * <ul>
 * 
 * <li>The <code>getJPEGFrameGrabber()</code>
 * method returns a {@link JPEGFrameGrabber} 
 * object capable of capturing frames and converting  them to JPEG
 * before handing them out. This frame grabber cannot be used with
 * all video sources. It requires images from the video source to 
 * be in some pre-defined formats in order to be converted to JPEG. If
 * the video source is not capable of handing out images in one of the supported
 * formats, then no <code>JPEGFrameGrabber</code> can be created.</li>
 *  
 * <li>The <code>getRGBFrameGrabber()</code> & <code>getBGRFrameGrabber()</code>
 * methods return either an {@link RGBFrameGrabber} or {@link BGRFrameGrabber} 
 * object capable of capturing frames and converting  them to RGB24 / BGR24
 * before handing them out. Here again, these frame grabbers cannot be used with
 * all video sources. They require images from the video source to 
 * be in some pre-defined formats in order to be converted to RGB24 or BGR24. If
 * the video source is not capable of handing out images in one of the supported
 * formats, then no <code>RGBFrameGrabber</code> / <code>BGRFrameGrabber</code>
 * can be created.</li>
 * 
 * <li>The <code>getYUVFrameGrabber()</code> & <code>getYVUFrameGrabber()</code>
 * methods return either an {@link YUVFrameGrabber} or {@link YVUFrameGrabber} 
 * object capable of capturing frames and converting  them to YUV420 / YVU420
 * before handing them out. Here again, these frame grabbers cannot be used with
 * all video sources. They require images from the video source to 
 * be in some pre-defined formats in order to be converted to YUV420 or YVU420.
 * If the video source is not capable of handing out images in one of the 
 * supported formats, then no <code>YUVFrameGrabber</code> / 
 * <code>YVUFrameGrabber</code> can be created.</li>
 * 
 * <li>The <code>getRawFrameGrabber()</code> methods return a 
 * {@link RawFrameGrabber} object capable of capturing frames in one of the 
 * supported image formats, as reported by the 
 * {@link DeviceInfo#getFormatList() getFormatList()} method of 
 * {@link DeviceInfo} objects. Captured frames are handed out straight away to 
 * the caller, without any other form of processing.</li>
 * <li>The <code>getJPEGFrameGrabber()</code> methods return a 
 * {@link JPEGFrameGrabber} object capable of capturing frames and JPEG-encoding
 * them before handing them out.</li>
 * 
 * </ul>
 * To check whether JPEG, RGB, BGR, YUV or YVU conversion is supported by a 
 * <code>VideoDevice</code> object, call its {@link #supportJPEGConversion()}, 
 * {@link #supportRGBConversion()}, {@link #supportBGRConversion()},
 * {@link #supportYUVConversion()} or {@link #supportYVUConversion()} method.
 * <b>Similarly to <code>VideoDevice</code> objects, once the frame grabber is 
 * no longer used, its resources must be released.</b> This is achieved by 
 * calling the {@link #releaseFrameGrabber()}. See the 
 * {@link FrameGrabber} interface for more information on how to capture frames.
 * 
 * <h2>Tuners</h2>
 * A list of available tuners can be obtained by calling the 
 * {@link #getTunerList()} method. Each {@link Tuner} object in the list
 * represents an individual tuner and allow getting/setting of various 
 * parameters, including the frequency.
 * 
 * <h2>Video controls</h2>
 * A list of available video controls can be obtained by calling the 
 * {@link #getControlList()} method. Each control contains detailed information 
 * about its type and acceptable values. Controls have a pair of get & set 
 * methods to adjust their values. Once again, when no longer used, resources 
 * taken up by video controls must be released by calling 
 * {@link #releaseControlList()}. See the {@link ControlList} and 
 * {@link Control} classes for more information on how to use them.
