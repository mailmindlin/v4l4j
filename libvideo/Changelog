v0.9.1:
- remove libv4lconvert and add external dependency
- remove PixFC
- remove deprecated FrameGrabber.GetVideoFrame() method
- fix a couple of crashes with unhandled pixel formats, unhandled control types
v0.9:
- add set/get methods to switch input
- add support for integer64, strings and bitmask V4L controls
- updated libv4l to v0.8.6
- make libv4lconvert use SSE conversion routines from PixFC for some pixel 
  format conversions
- fix NullPointerException bug with PAC webcams
- fix Makefile so linking works with later versions of gcc
- fix issue when stopping / starting the capture without re-setting the 
  CaptureCallback object
- experimental ARM support (armv7 only for now)
v0.8.10:
- fix nasty bug reported by Florent and Eric on the ML causing JPEG frame
  grabbers to segfault on release, and lines from different frame grabbers to
  mix with each other during JPEG conversion. Thanks to both of them for 
  reporting and testing fixes.
- deprecated frame grabber pull mode in favour of push mode to improve frame
  delivery accuracy
- updated javadoc
- added more example apps
v0.8.9:
- reworked frame delivery method - added push and pull modes
- frames are encapsulated in VideoFrame object, delivered to java in byte[]
- minimised number of copies required per captured frame: at most 1 copy / conversion
  from v4l to java byte{}
- added sequence and capture time as metadata 
- added CamServer example appplication
v0.8.7:
- Updated  to libv4l v0.6.3
- fix minor bug in previous version preventing desktop shortcut to launch the
  application
v0.8.6:
- added support for adjustable frame rate
v0.8.5:
- updated to latest videodev2.h from v4l mercurial repository.
- updated to libv4l v0.6
- fix bug caused by v4lconvert_try_format not failing when given an unsupported
  format 
v0.8.4:
- updated to libv4l v0.5.99
v0.8.3:
- modified build system to simplify Debian packaging
v0.8.2:
- added resolution information to image formats
v0.8.1:
- Fixed bug in svn-version.sh
v0.8:
- renamed libv4l to libvideo
- Added libvideo convert code (libv4l v0.5.0) from Hans de Goede
v0.5.7:
- Reorganised V4L control code and driver probe sections.
- Now, multiple driver probes can be successful (instead of only 1 before),
  allowing for "plugin"-style code adding functionnality based on the driver
  in use
- header files for V4L control have been reorganised
v0.5.6:
- Added selection of the best palette to achieve capture resolution closest
  to the one requested. After adding support for linux UVC driver, i noticed
  MJPEG palette couldnt capture at higher resolutions (>930x720), whereas
  YUYV could. So now, the best palette is chosen (amongst the one requested
  by user) so the resolution is as close as possible to the one requested.
v0.5.5:
- Added detection and reporting of extended controls (first pass). The
  extended controls are listed, duplicates with classic controls are removed
  and the unique ones are reported as normal V4L2 controls. The next step is
  to add methods to the interface so ext. controls can be changed at once.
- Tested Logitech Quickcam Communicate Deluxe with the linux UVC driver, for
  which I added support for YUYV (YUV422) and MJPEG formats. There is no need
  to probe the linux UVC driver as it doesnt have any private ioctl (as of
  SVN revision 246).

v0.5.4:
- replaced libv4l generic code with a struct libv4l_actions to avoid the
  overhead of calling two methods to get the job done(1 method to check the
  V4L version and another to do the job). Instead, the user now calls
  the right method straight away by using struct libv4l_actions which is
  set at initialisation and points to the right methods straight away.
  
v0.5.3:
- Improved mmap code for V4L1
- added error return codes and improved console output when initialisation
  & setup of video device fails
- added support for more image formats. The whole list :
  YUV420 - RGB24 - RGB32 - YUYV - RGB555 - RGB565 - GREY
- user can now specify a list of acceptable image formats 

v0.5.1:
- Added support for V4L1 devices
- renamed to libv4l


v0.3.1:
- Grouped open_device() and check_cap_param() under init_libv4l2() to fix an
  issue with controls being listed before checking if the video device is V4L2
- as a consequence, close_device() is now called by del_libv4l2()

v0.3.0:
- Fixed buffer overrun issues with probe-pwc
- dropped frame.c and frame.h
