# v4l4j

This is a port of the v4l4j library, originally at [code.google.com/p/v4l4j](https://code.google.com/archive/p/v4l4j/) [[svn](https://v4l4j.googlecode.com/svn/)].
As far as I can tell, this project hasn't been worked on since around 2013, and is in need of an update. Major things that I
will be focusing on include:

 - Documenting the code
 - Adding more tutorials & reference documents
 - Fixing compatibility with newer software
 - Optimizing some of the methods, including using SIMD
